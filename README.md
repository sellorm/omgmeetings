# OMG Meetings!

Many of us spend far too much time in meetings.

What if there was a way to track how much each meeting is costing your business?

Well now there is!

OMG Meetings is a simple tool that lets you track how much money you're ~~wasting~~ spending on your meetings.

Just add in the number of attendees, their average hourly salary, and hit 'start', and  watch in horror as the the cost racks up!

Probably based on an idea I heard somewhere else and then couldn't find again.
